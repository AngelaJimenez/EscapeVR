## Description  
The project is a cooperative virtual reality game following the dynamics of an escape room. This means the players, in this case, two, will be immersed in a virtual environment set in the medieval era, and they will have the task of solving various puzzles to escape confinement. The puzzles they face will test their ability to work as a team and communicate their ideas effectively.

## Objective  
The aim of this project is to evaluate the impact of virtual environments on players' communication and relationship skills, specifically their ability to work as a team.

## Instructions for Execution  
1. Unity version 2021.3.5f1 was used, so it is necessary to download this version for all files to be installed correctly.  
2. Clone the repository.  
3. Open UnityHub and add the project by selecting the folder where the repository was cloned.  
4. Connect the virtual reality headset and enable the Quest Link option. The game must be run from the computer, so a cable connection is necessary.  
5. Check the internet connection.  
6. Since the game is for two players, these steps must be repeated on another computer.  
7. Open the game in Unity on both computers and press the Play button. If the game is paused, press the pause button again to execute the game.

## Known Issues  
- If there is a loss of connection, it is necessary to restart the game, as the player's camera will deactivate, causing dizziness. The game will become practically unusable.  
- The interactive objectives related to the gears are prone to desynchronization, so they must be manually adjusted in the scene, meaning in the Unity editor.
